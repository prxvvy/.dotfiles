/* Tags
 * In a traditional dwm the number of tags in use can be changed simply by
 * changing the number of strings in the tags array. This build does things a
 * bit different which has some added benefits. If you need to change the number
 * of tags here then change the NUMTAGS macro in dwm.c.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *  1) static char *tagicons[][NUMTAGS*2] = {
 *         [DEFAULT_TAGS] = { "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "A",
 * "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I" },
 *     }
 *
 *  2) static char *tagicons[][1] = {
 *         [DEFAULT_TAGS] = { "•" },
 *     }
 *
 * The first example would result in the tags on the first monitor to be 1
 * through 9, while the tags for the second monitor would be named A through I.
 * A third monitor would start again at 1 through 9 while the tags on a fourth
 * monitor would also be named A through I. Note the tags count of NUMTAGS*2 in
 * the array initialiser which defines how many tag text / icon exists in the
 * array. This can be changed to *3 to add separate icons for a third monitor.
 *
 * For the second example each tag would be represented as a bullet point. Both
 * cases work the same from a technical standpoint - the icon index is derived
 * from the tag index and the monitor index. If the icon index is is greater
 * than the number of tag icons then it will wrap around until it an icon
 * matches. Similarly if there are two tag icons then it would alternate between
 * them. This works seamlessly with alternative tags and alttagsdecoration
 * patches.
