I created a simple program which automates the installation of the Vim plugins. Why? Because it was very annoying to clone every simple Github repo after switching from a distro so let this program's magic do its thing.

# Atm, this program ain't no yet finished but will be soon. 

### Package manager
I use Vim's native package manager because I just don't like automated ones so if you are using an automated like VimPlug probably don't wanna use this program.
